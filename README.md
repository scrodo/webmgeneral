# WEBM GENERAL CONVERTER
A video to webm conversion tool used to create high quality webms that stay below 4chan's file size limit.

The current version was designed to run on Windows computers. I might create versions in the future for other OSâ€™s.

Latest release: https://github.com/voxgibson/webmgeneral/releases/tag/v1.4

Note: To run the program from source requires python 3.7 (The portable version does not require python installation.)

The program was written in Python.

It uses ffmpeg to convert videos to webms.

The Windows portable versions were made using pyinstaller along with WinZip Self-Extractor.
