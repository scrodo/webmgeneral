# WEBM GENERAL CONVERTER
A video to webm conversion tool used to create high quality webms that stay below 4chan's file size limit.

The current version was designed to work with Windows computers. I might create versions in the future for other OSâ€™s.  

Latest release: https://github.com/voxgibson/webmgeneral/releases/tag/v1.3

It uses ffmpeg to convert videos. 

The Windows portable versions were made using pyinstaller along with WinZip Self-Extractor.
